# .gitignore file:
# Specifies intentionally untracked files for this repository
# Find documentation (syntax) here: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
#
# White-listing approach: forbid everything, only allow explicitly
#
# We aim not to cover all cases, things can always be added by "-f" manually;
# and files already tracked by Git are not affected anyway.
