The technique can also be used to design faster sorting programs in parallel processors. The technique is illustrated, in this book, with two network designs that are faster than the corresponding merge-sorting designs: an 18-key network using only 11 steps and a 22-key network using only 12 steps.},

There are collisions every 25 ns, corresponding to a rate of 40 MHz. A three-level trigger system reduces this rate to about 200 Hz while keeping bunch crossings which potentially contain interesting processes. The Level-1 trigger, implemented in electronics and firmware, makes an initial selection in under 2.5 mus with an output rate of less than 100 kHz. A key element of this is the central trigger processor (CTP) which combines trigger information from the calorimeter and muon trigger processors to make the final Level-1 accept decision in under 100 ns on the basis of lists of selection criteria, implemented as a trigger menu. Timing and trigger signals are fanned out to all sub-detectors, while busy signals from all sub-detector read-out systems are collected and fed into the CTP in order to throttle the generation of Level-1 triggers},

  abstract = {The ATLAS detector at CERN's LHC will be exposed to proton-proton collisions at a bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz. In order to reduce the data rate, a three-level trigger system selects potentially interesting physics processes. The first trigger level is implemented in electronics and firmware. It aims at reducing the output rate to less than 100 kHz. The central trigger processor (CTP) combines information from the calorimeter and muon trigger processors and makes the final Level-1-Accept (L1A) decision. It is a central element in the timing setup of the experiment. Three aspects are considered in this article: the timing setup with respect to the Level-1 trigger, with respect to the experiment, and with respect to the world. Trigger signals from the muon and calorimeter trigger processors have to be synchronized in phase with respect to the local clock, and aligned in terms of the bunch crossing they originate from. The Level-1 latency is defined as the time between the collision and the arrival of the L1A at the sub-detectors. It is fixed and less than 2.5 musec. During this time, the data from all sub-detectors are stored in front-end pipeline buffers. In order to guarantee read-out of the same collision, the pipeline lengths must be carefully tuned in order to match the Level-1 latency using several strategies with and without particle beam. The CTP further calculates a UTC time stamp derived from a GPS-based time-stamping system with a stability of 5 nsec and high absolute time precision. The time stamp will allow us to correlate ATLAS events with those in other particle-physics or astronomic detectors at CERN or elsewhere},

  title = {Learning-{{Based Hardware Design}} for {{Data Acquisition Systems}}},
  author = {Aprile, Cosimo},
  abstract = {This multidisciplinary research work aims to investigate the optimized information extraction from signals or data volumes and to develop tailored hardware implementations that trade-off the complexity of data acquisition with that of data processing, conceptually allowing radically new device designs. The mathematical results in classical Compressive Sampling (CS) support the paradigm of Analog-to-Information Conversion (AIC) as a replacement for conventional ADC technologies. The AICs simultaneously perform data acquisition and compression, seeking to directly sample signals for achieving specific tasks as opposed to acquiring a full signal only at the Nyquist rate to throw most of it away via compression. Our contention is that in order for CS to live up its name, both theory and practice must leverage concepts from learning. This work demonstrates our contention in hardware prototypes, with key trade-offs, for two different fields of application as edge and big-data computing. In the framework of edge-data computing, such as wearable and implantable ecosystems, the power budget is defined by the battery capacity, which generally limits the device performance and usability. This is more evident in very challenging field, such as medical monitoring, where high performance requirements are necessary for the device to process the information with high accuracy. Furthermore, in applications like implantable medical monitoring, the system performances have to merge the small area as well as the low-power requirements, in order to facilitate the implant bio-compatibility, avoiding the rejection from the human body. Based on our new mathematical foundations, we built different prototypes to get a neural signal acquisition chip that not only rigorously trades off its area, energy consumption, and the quality of its signal output, but also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in all aspects. In the framework of big-data and high-performance computation, such as in high-end servers application, the RF circuits meant to transmit data from chip-to-chip or chip-to-memory are defined by low power requirements, since the heat generated by the integrated circuits is partially distributed by the chip package. Hence, the overall system power budget is defined by its affordable cooling capacity. For this reason, application specific architectures and innovative techniques are used for low-power implementation. In this work, we have developed a single-ended multi-lane receiver for high speed I/O link in servers application. The receiver operates at 7 Gbps by learning inter-symbol interference and electromagnetic coupling noise in chip-to-chip communication systems. A learning-based approach allows a versatile receiver circuit which not only copes with large channel attenuation but also implements novel crosstalk reduction techniques, to allow single-ended multiple lines transmission, without sacrificing its overall bandwidth for a given area within the interconnect's data-path.},

It is capable of measuring the sagitta of muon tracks to an accuracy of 60 {$\mu$}m, which corresponds to a momentum accuracy of about 10\% at p T = 1 TeV. The design and performance of the MDT readout electronics as well as the electronics for controlling, monitoring and powering the detector will be discussed. These electronics have been extensively tested under simulated running conditions and have undergone radiation testing certifying them for more than 10 years of LHC operation.

An all-digital PLL employs a digitally controlled oscillator with switching current sources to reduce supply voltage and power without sacrificing its startup margin. It also reduces 1/f noise and supply pushing, thus allowing the ADPLL, after settling, to reduce its sampling rate or shut it off entirely during a direct DCO data modulation. The switching power amplifier integrates its matching network while operating in class-E/F2 to maximally enhance its efficiency at low voltage. The transmitter is realized in 28 nm digital CMOS and satisfies all metal density and other manufacturing rules.

For embedded systems, a uniprocessor software solution is often not applicable due to the low performance, while realizing multiprocessor sorting methods on parallel computers is much too expensive with respect to power consumption, physical weight, and cost. We investigate cost/performance tradeoffs for hybrid sorting algorithms that use a mixture of sequential merge sort and systolic insertion sort techniques. We propose a scalable architecture for integer sorting that consists of a uniprocessor and an FPGA-based parallel systolic co-processor. Speedups obtained analytically and experimentally and depending on hardware (cost) constraints are determined as a function of time constants of the uniprocessor and the co-processor.},

  abstract = {The Muon to Central Trigger Processor Interface (MUCTPI) is part of the ATLAS Level-1 trigger system and connects the output of muon trigger system to the Central Trigger Processor (CTP). At every bunch crossing (BC), the MUCTPI receives information on muon candidates from each of the 208 muon trigger sectors and calculates the total multiplicity for each of six transverse momentum (pT) thresholds. This multiplicity value is then sent to the CTP, where it is used together with the input from the Calorimeter trigger to make the final Level-1 Accept (L1A) decision. In addition the MUCTPI provides summary information to the Level-2 trigger and to the data acquisition (DAQ) system for events selected at Level-1. This information is used to define the regions of interest (RoIs) that drive the Level-2 muontrigger processing. The MUCTPI system consists of a 9U VME chassis with a dedicated active backplane and 18 custom designed modules. The design of the modules is based on state-of-the-art FPGA devices and special attention was paid to low-latency in the data transmission and processing. We present the design and implementation of the final version of the MUCTPI. A partially populated MUCTPI system is already installed in the ATLAS experiment and is being used regularly for commissioning tests and combined cosmic ray data taking runs.},

In this method, the numerator of the approximated filter is part of the FIR filter itself and no calculations and minimization are needed to find the numerator coefficients (except finding the FIR roots). An error analysis between the given FIR and approximated IIR filters is provided. This error analysis enables the designer to fix a design parameter, often unnoted, keeping the energies of the approximated and original filters equal.

  abstract = {In the Technical Proposals for ATLAS, CMS and ALICE there is a requirement for several thousand data links. Although there is an obvious need for standardisation, this seems difficult to achieve as the links run at different speeds, over different distances and have various constraints of power consumption, size and radiation hardness. An additional complication is that today we cannot decide which will be the most cost effective technology for the implementation of the final links. Furthermore, we must allow designers of boards at each end of the link, for example readout electronics and input buffers, to work in parallel with the development of the links. The S-LINK is a new concept which should provide the benefits of standardisation without the limitations. The S-LINK specification defines, at both ends of the link, a simple FIFO-like user interface which remains independent of the technology used to implement the physical link. The physical link provides transfer of event data and control words, error detection, optional flow control and test facilities. This paper describes the S-LINK specification and gives examples of the use of the S-LINK the physical links being designed, and the test equipment that is being developed.},

Over the past five years, authors Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher have analyzed hundreds of examples of "bad code" (much of it their own) to determine why they're bad and how they could be improved. Their conclusion? You need to write code that minimizes the time it would take someone else to understand it -- even if that someone else is you. This book focuses on basic principles and practical techniques you can apply every time you write code. Using easy-to-digest code examples from different languages, each chapter dives into a different aspect of coding, and demonstrates how you can make your code easy to understand. Simplify naming, commenting, and formatting with tips that apply to every line of code; Refine your program's loops, logic, and variables to reduce complexity and confusion; Attack problems at the function level, such as reorganizing blocks of code to do one task at a time; Write effective test code that is thorough and concise, as well as readable. - Publisher},

Knuth detailed, in Volume 3 of "The Art of Computer Programming", sorting networks of the smallest depth known at the time for n ={$<$} 16 inputs, quoting optimality for n ={$<$} 8. In 1989, Parberry proved the optimality of the networks with 9 ={$<$} n ={$<$} 10 inputs. In this article, we present a general technique for obtaining such optimality results, and use it to prove the optimality of the remaining open cases of 11 ={$<$} n ={$<$} 16 inputs. We show how to exploit symmetry to construct a small set of two-layer networks on n inputs such that if there is a sorting network on n inputs of a given depth, then there is one whose first layers are in this set. For each network in the resulting set, we construct a propositional formula whose satisfiability is necessary for the existence of a sorting network of a given depth. Using an off-the-shelf SAT solver we show that the sorting networks listed by Knuth are optimal. For n ={$<$} 10 inputs, our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the prior ones.},

  abstract = {The ATLAS experiment is located at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. It is designed to measure decay properties of highly energetic particles produced in the protons collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC has a beam collision frequency of 40 MHz, and thus requires a trigger system to efficiently select events, thereby reducing the storage rate to a manageable level of about 400 Hz. Event triggering is therefore one of the extraordinary challenges faced by the ATLAS detector. The Level-1 Trigger is the first rate-reducing step in the ATLAS Trigger, with an output rate of 75 kHz and decision latency of less than 2.5 {$\mu$}s. It is primarily composed of the Calorimeter Trigger, Muon Trigger, the Central Trigger Processor (CTP). Due to the increase in the LHC instantaneous luminosity up to 3\texttimes{}1034 cm-2 s-1 from 2015 onwards, a new element will be included in the Level-1 Trigger scheme: the Topological Processor (L1Topo). The L1Topo receives data in a specialized format from the calorimeters and muon detectors to be processed by specific topological algorithms. Those algorithms sit in high-end FPGAs which perform geometrical cuts, correlations and calculate complex observables such as the invariant mass. The outputs of such topological algorithms are sent to the CTP. Since the Level-1 trigger is a fixed latency pipelined system, the main requirements for the L1Topo are a large input bandwidth ({$\approx$}1Tb/s), optical connectivity and low processing latency on the real-time data path. This presentation focuses on the design of the L1Topo final production module and the tests results on L1Topo prototypes. Such tests are aimed at characterizing high-speed links (signal integrity, bit error rate, margin analysis and latency) and the logic resource utilization of algorithms.},

Retiming technique is applied to minimize the number of registers that cannot be merged with combinational blocks. We formulate the problem as an integer linear program. We show that the constraint matrix of the integer program is totally unimodular. As a result, we can solve our logic module minimization problem optimally by solving the linear relaxation of the integer program.},

An IC comprises of millions of transistors etched on a small piece (say 10 mm x 10 mm) of doped silicon (a widely used semiconductor) with appropriate interconnections between them depending upon the desired functionality. Just compare this design complexity with the era of vacuum tubes where one vacuum tube was used to do the same functionality of a single transistor. Some of you may very well have seen the old age radio receiver box back where five or six such vacuum tubes could be seen lighting. Naturally, even that would be considered complex in those days relative to the technology and tools available in those times. All the design and manufacturing used to be mostly manual.},

Analytic expressions for the variance of amplitude and timing measurements are found through a frequency domain approach.

We present new parallel sorting networks for 17 to 20 inputs. For 17, 19, and 20 inputs these networks are faster than the previously known best networks.

As a corollary, we obtain that the 29-comparator network found by Waksman in 1969 is optimal when sorting 10 inputs. This closes the two smallest open instances of the optimal-size sorting network problem, which have been open since the results of Floyd and Knuth from 1966 proving optimality for sorting networks of up to 8 inputs. The proof involves a combination of two methodologies: one based on exploiting the abundance of symmetries in sorting networks, and the other based on an encoding of the problem to that of satisfiability of propositional logic. We illustrate that, while each of these can single-handedly solve smaller instances of the problem, it is their combination that leads to the more efficient solution that scales to handle 9 inputs.},

  abstract = {This Technical Design Report documents the plans to upgrade the ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition system for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The HL-LHC is expected to start operations in the middle of 2026, to ultimately reach a peak instantaneous luminosity of \&quot;L = 7.5\textbackslash{}times 10\^\{34\} cm\^\{-2\}s\^\{-1\}\&quot;, corresponding to approximately 200 inelastic proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing, and to deliver more than ten times the integrated luminosity of the LHC Runs 1-3 combined (up to 4000 fb\&quot;\^\{-1\}\&quot;). Meeting these requirements poses significant challenges to the Trigger and to the Data Acquisition system to fully exploit the physics potential of the HL-LHC. A baseline architecture, based on a single-level hardware trigger with a maximum rate of 1 MHz and 10 ms latency, is proposed and documented. With the help of a hardware-based tracking subsystem as co-processor, software-based reconstruction follows to achieve further rejection. Up to 10 kHz event data are sent into storage. The Report describes in detail the physics motivations, the requirements, the fundamental parameters, the technical design implementation, and the expected performance of the proposed upgrade. The Report also documents the organisation of the Upgrade Project, its management structure, planning and scheduling with a review of the major milestones, and costing information.},

  abstract = {Escalating system-on-chip design complexity is pushing the design community to raise the level of abstraction beyond register transfer level. Despite the unsuccessful adoptions of early generations of commercial high-level synthesis (HLS) systems, we believe that the tipping point for transitioning to HLS msystem-on-chip design complexityethodology is happening now, especially for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) designs. The latest generation of HLS tools has made significant progress in providing wide language coverage and robust compilation technology, platform-based modeling, advancement in core HLS algorithms, and a domain-specific approach. In this paper, we use AutoESL's AutoPilot HLS tool coupled with domain-specific system-level implementation platforms developed by Xilinx as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of state-of-art C-to-FPGA synthesis solutions targeting multiple application domains. Complex industrial designs targeting Xilinx FPGAs are also presented as case studies, including comparison of HLS solutions versus optimized manual designs. In particular, the experiment on a sphere decoder shows that the HLS solution can achieve an 11-31\% reduction in FPGA resource usage with improved design productivity compared to hand-coded design.},

To handle the high event rate (up to 100 kHz) and bandwidth (up to 160 MB/s per link) the readout PCs are equipped with four ROBIN (readout buffer input) cards. Each ROBIN attaches to three optical links, provides local event buffering for approximately 300 ms and communicates with the higher-level trigger system for data and delete requests. According to the ATLAS baseline architecture this communication runs via the PCI bus of the host PC. In addition, each ROBIN provides a private Gigabit Ethernet port which can be used for the same purpose. Operational monitoring is performed via PCI. This paper presents a summary of the ROBIN hardware and software together with measurements results obtained from various test setups.},

A completely monolithic design has been made feasible by using an optimized hollow-coil inductor low-phase-noise voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The frequency divider is an eight-modulus phase-switching prescaler that achieves the same speed as asynchronous dividers. The die area was minimized by using a dual-path active loop filter. An indirect linearization technique was implemented for the VCO gain. The resulting architecture is a fourth-order, type-2 charge-pump phase-locked loop. The measured settling time is 300 {$\mu$}s, and the phase noise is up to -123 dBc/Hz at 600 kHz and -138 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz offset},

  abstract = {Retiming is an effective technique to optimize the performance of synchronous sequential circuits. This paper proposes a method to improve the effectiveness of retiming by transforming the sequential circuit. Bottlenecks which prevent retiming to achieve a desired clock period are identified. Conditions to eliminate the retiming bottlenecks are derived. These conditions are satisfied by a process of identifying sub-circuits and satisfying a set of timing constraints on the sub-circuits. The transformed circuit, which satisfies the timing constraints, can be retimed to achieve the desired clock period. If the original circuit has its initial state specified, our method always generates the final circuit with an equivalentinitial state. Experimental results on a variety of sequential benchmark circuits demonstrate significant performance improvement.},

As illustrated in Fig. 11.1, the basic dc conversion property is modeled by an effective dc transformer, having a turns ratio equal to the conversion ratio M(D). This model predicts that the converter has a voltage-source output characteristic, such that the output voltage is essentially independent of the load current or load resistance R. We have also seen how to refine this model, to predict losses and efficiency, converter dynamics, and small-signal ac transfer functions. We found that the transfer functions of the buck converter contain two low-frequency poles, owing to the converter filter inductor and capacitor. The control-to-output transfer functions of the boost and buck-boost converters additionally contain a right half-plane zero. Finally, we have seen how to utilize these results in the design of converter control systems.},

For example, in a typical dc-dc converter application, the output voltage v(t) must be kept constant, regardless of changes in the input voltage v g (t) or in the effective load resistance R. This is accomplished by building a circuit that varies the converter control input [i.e., the duty cycle d(t)] in such a way that the output voltage v(t) is regulated to be equal to a desired reference value v ref . In inverter systems, a feedback loop causes the output voltage to follow a sinusoidal reference voltage. In modern low-harmonic rectifier systems, a control system causes the converter input current to be proportional to the input voltage, such that the input port presents a resistive load to the ac source. So feedback is commonly employed.},

In a dc-dc converter application, it is desired to obtain a constant output voltage v(t) = V, in spite of disturbances in v g (t) and i load (t and in spite of variations in the converter circuit element values. The sources of these disturbances and variations are many, and a typical situation is illustrated in Fig. 9.1. The input voltage v g (t) of an off-line power supply may typically contain periodic variations at the second harmonic of the ac power system frequency (100 Hz or 120 Hz), produced by a rectifier circuit. The magnitude of vg(t) may also vary when neighboring power system loads are switched on or off. The load current i load (t) may contain variations of significant amplitude, and a typical power supply specification is that the output voltage must remain within a specified range (for example, 3.3 V {$\pm$} 0.05 V) when the load current takes a step change from, for example, full rated load current to 50\% of the rated current, and vice versa. The values of the circuit elements are constructed to a certain tolerance, and so in high-volume manufacturing of a converter, converters are constructed whose output voltages lie in some distribution. It is desired that essentially all of this distribution fall within the specified range; however, this is not practical to achieve without the use of negative feedback. Similar considerations apply to inverter applications, except that the output voltage is ac.},

Components and other portions of the system are modeled as appropriate, often with vendor-supplied data. 4. Design-oriented analysis of the circuit is performed. This involves development of equations that allow element values to be chosen such that specifications and design goals are met. In addition, it may be necessary for the engineer to gain additional understanding and physical insight into the circuit behavior, so that the design can be improved by adding elements to the circuit or by changing circuit connections. 5. Model verification. Predictions of the model are compared to a laboratory prototype, under nominal operating conditions. The model is refined as necessary, so that the model predictions agree with laboratory measurements. 6. Worst-case analysis (or other reliability and production yield analysis) of the circuit is performed. This involves quantitative evaluation of the model performance, to judge whether specifications are met under all conditions. Computer simulation is well-suited to this task. 7. Iteration.

The key element is the switching converter, illustrated in Fig. 1.1. In general, a switching converter contains power input and control input ports, and a power output port. The raw input power is processed as specified by the control input, yielding the conditioned output power. One of several basic functions can be performed [2]. In a dc-dc converter, the dc input voltage is converted to a dc output voltage having a larger or smaller magnitude, possibly with opposite polarity or with isolation of the input and output ground references. In an ac-dc rectifier, an ac input voltage is rectified, producing a dc output voltage. The dc output voltage and/or ac input current waveform may be controlled. The inverse process, dc-ac inversion, involves transforming a dc input voltage into an ac output voltage of controllable magnitude and frequency. Ac-ac cycloconversion involves converting an ac input voltage to a given ac output voltage of controllable magnitude and frequency.},

A textbook could cover the topic simply by discussing the various circuits, such as the peak-detection and inductor-input rectifiers, the phase-controlled bridge, polyphase transformer connections, and perhaps multiplier circuits. But recently, rectifiers have become much more sophisticated, and are now systems rather than mere circuits. They often include pulse-width modulated converters such as the boost converter, with control systems that regulate the ac input current waveform. So modern rectifier technology now incorporates many of the dc-dc converter fundamentals.},

  abstract = {In the previous chapter, the buck converter was introduced as a means of reducing the dc voltage, using only nondissipative switches, inductors, and capacitors. The switch produces a rectangular waveform v s (t) as illustrated in Fig. 2.1. The voltage v s (t) is equal to the dc input voltage V g when the switch is in position 1, and is equal to zero when the switch is in position 2. In practice, the switch is realized using power semiconductor devices, such as transistors and diodes, which are controlled to turn on and off as required to perform the function of the ideal switch. The switching frequency f s , equal to the inverse of the switching period T s , generally lies in the range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz, depending on the switching speed of the semiconductor devices. The duty ratio D is the fraction of time that the switch spends in position 1, and is a number between zero and one. The complement of the duty ratio, D', is defined as (1 \textendash{} D).},

However timing synchronization applications and triggers systems of the high energy physics experiments would benefit from fixed-latency links.

  abstract = {The Muon to Central Trigger Processor Interface (MUCTPI) of the ATLAS Level-1 trigger receives data from the sector logic modules of the muon trigger at every bunch crossing and calculates the total multiplicity of muon candidates, which is then sent to the Central Trigger Processor where the final Level-1 decision is taken. The MUCTPI system consists of a 9U VME crate with a special backplane and 18 custom designed modules. We focus on the design and implementation of the octant module (MIOCT). Each of the 16 MIOCT modules processes the muon candidates from 13 sectors of one half-octant of the detector and forms the local muon candidate multiplicities for the trigger decision. It also resolves the overlaps between chambers in order to avoid double-counting of muon candidates that are detected in more than one sector. The handling of overlapping sectors is based on Look-Up-Tables (LUT) for maximum flexibility. The MIOCT also sends the information on the muon candidates over the custom backplane via the Readout Driver module to the Level-2 trigger and the DAQ systems when a Level-1 Accept is received. The design is based on state-of-the-art FPGA devices and special attention was paid to low-latency in the data transmission and processing.},

Both the large-signal lock acquisition process and the small-signal linear tracking behavior are described using this analysis. The nonlinear state equations are linearized for the small-signal condition and the z-domain noise transfer functions are derived. A comparison to some of the existing analysis methods such as the impulse-invariant transformation and s-domain analysis is provided. The effect of the loop parameters and the reference frequency on the loop phase margin and stability is analyzed. The analysis is verified using behavioral simulations in MATLAB and SPECTRE.},

The bus includes four subbuses: data transfer bus, priority interrupt bus, arbitration bus, and utility bus. The data transfer bus supports 8-, 16-, and 32-bit transfers over a nonmultiplexed 32-bit data and address highway. The transfer protocols are asynchronous and fully handshaken. The priority interrupt bus provides real-time interrupt services to the system. The allocation of bus mastership is performed by the arbitration bus, which allows to implement round robin and prioritized arbitration algorithms. The utility bus provides the system with power-up and power-down synchronization. The mechanical specifications of boards, backplanes, subracks, and enclosures are based on IEC 297 specification also known as the Euroboard form factor.{$<>$}},

In this paper, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based binary32 floating point multiplier (FPM) is presented to support variety of pipeline depth and the effects of pipeline architecture have been investigated. Pipeline architecture is formulated based on radix-4 Booth recoding approach, an improved Wallace tree, and partial product accumulation. Upon detail and quantitative investigation on the proposed architecture on both cutting edge Xilinx and Altera devices, pipeline depth affects maximum running frequency much more than power consumption, and the pipeline depth should be limited to obtain maximum running frequency for binary32 FPM on both cutting edge target devices, which is consistent to the previous study. Meanwhile, the study demonstrates the pipeline depth to reach at peak performance is lower than that of targeting at FPGA device with 4-input LUTs years ago.},

They can be seen as a pillar for some applications such as decision support systems, path planning, etc. However, sorting large number of elements needs high computation rate. Consequently, accelerating sorting algorithms using hardware implementation is an interesting solution to speed up computations. The purpose of this paper is to develop a hardware accelerated version of TimSort and MergeSort algorithms from high level descriptions. The algorithms are implemented using Zynq-7000 xilinx platform as part of real time decision support for avionic applications. As experimental results, we compare the performance of two algorithms in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We showed that TimSort ranges from 1.07x to 1.16x faster than MergeSort when optimized hardware is used.

  abstract = {In order to benefit from the expected high luminosity performance that will be provided by the Phase-I upgraded LHC, the first station of the ATLAS muon end-cap system (Small Wheel,SW) will need to be replaced. The New Small Wheel (NSW) will have to operate in a high background radiation region (up to 15 kHz=cm2) while reconstructing muon tracks with high precision, as well as furnishing information for the Level-1 trigger. These performance criteria are demanding. In particular, the precision reconstruction of tracks for offline analysis requires a spatial resolution of about 100microns, and the Level-1 trigger track segments have to be reconstructed online with an angular resolution of approximately 1mrad. The NSW will have two chamber technologies, one primarily devoted to the Level-1 trigger function (small-strip Thin Gap Chambers, sTGC) and one dedicated to precision tracking (Micromegas detectors, MM). The sTGC are primarily deployed for triggering given their single bunch crossing identification capability. The MM detectors have exceptional precision tracking capabilities due to their small gap (5mm) and strip pitch (approximately 0.5mm). Such a precision is crucial to maintain the current ATLAS muon momentum resolution in the high background environment of the upgraded LHC. The MM chambers can, at the same time, confirm the existence of track segments found by the muon end-cap middle station (Big Wheels) online. The sTGC also has the ability to measure offline muon tracks with good precision, so the sTGC-MM chamber technology combination forms a fully redundant detector system for triggering and tracking both for online and offline functions. This detector combination has been designed to be able to also provide excellent performance for the eventual High Luminosity LHC upgrade.},

However, the final step in a single system identification loop is model validation. In this step the user has to decide whether the identified model is appropriate or not. Chapter 9 therefore focuses on methods that support the user in making the right decisions about the validity of the mathematical model of the system. To be a little bit more precise, and in line with the Popperian philosophy, validation does not usually guarantee validity, but just tries to test adequacy or fails to establish invalidity. The use of prior knowledge, model experience, and experimental data in the model validation step are emphasized and basically illustrated by a couple of examples. After introducing the methods for model validation, a real-world application, related to perishable food storage, is extensively introduced and discussed in terms of model validation.},

The design consists of two pipeline A/D channels with four Multiplying Digital-to-Analog Converters with nominal 12-bit resolution each. The design, fabricated in the IBM 130 nm CMOS process, shows a performance of 68 dB SNDR at 18 MHz for a single channel at 40 MS/s while consuming 55 mW/channel from a 2.5 V supply, and exhibits no performance degradation after irradiation. Various gain selection algorithms to achieve the extended dynamic range are implemented and tested.},

We show that retiming can be used to transform a given synchronous circuit into a more efficient circuit under a variety of different cost criteria. We model a circuit as a graph in which the vertex setV is a collection of combinational logic elements and the edge setE is the set of interconnections, each of which may pass through zero or more registers. We give anO(\textbrokenbar{}V{$\parallel$}E\textbrokenbar{}lg\textbrokenbar{}V\textbrokenbar{}) algorithm for determining an equivalent retimed circuit with the smallest possible clock period. We show that the problem of determining an equivalent retimed circuit with minimum state (total number of registers) is polynomial-time solvable. This result yields a polynomial-time optimal solution to the problem of pipelining combinational circuitry with minimum register cost. We also give a chacterization of optimal retiming based on an efficiently solvable mixed-integer linear-programming problem.},

However, most high-speed Serializer-Deserializer (SerDes) chips do not keep the same link latency after each power-up or reset. In this paper, we propose a fixed-latency serial transceiver based on dynamic clock phase shifting and changeable delay tuning technologies. Our solution can process all possible phase offsets between the transmitted and received clocks, so it relaxes the requirement of fanning in the same reference clock both to the transmitter and to the receiver. It also eliminates the reset-relock process in the roulette approach. We present a specific example of implementation based on the serial transceiver in Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA. The experiment results indicate that our transceiver can achieve a deterministic latency with sub-nanosecond precision.},

Having a fixed phase after startups is a major requirement, and the typical phase variations observed in the order of tens of picoseconds after startups while using the state-of-the-art design techniques are no longer sufficient. Each limitation observed in the transmitter and receiver paths of the high-speed transceivers embedded in the Xilinx Ultrascale FPGA family is further investigated and solutions are proposed. Tests in hardware using Xilinx FPGA evaluation boards are presented. In addition to a higher phase determinism, the techniques presented make it possible to fine-tune the skew of a link with a picosecond resolution, greatly simplifying clock-domain crossing inside the FPGAs and providing better short-term stability for the FPGA-recovered clock in a high-speed link.},

Such a trend opens up interesting opportunities but also raises immense challenges since the efficient use of heterogeneous many-core systems is not a trivial problem. Software-configurable microprocessors and FPGAs add further diversity but also increase complexity. In this paper, we explore the use of sorting networks on fieldprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs are very versatile in terms of how they can be used and can also be added as additional processing units in standard CPU sockets. Our results indicate that efficient usage of FPGAs involves non-trivial aspects such as having the right computation model (a sorting network in this case); a careful implementation that balances all the design constraints in an FPGA; and the proper integration strategy to link the FPGA to the rest of the system. Once these issues are properly addressed, our experiments show that FPGAs exhibit performance figures competitive with those of modern general-purpose CPUs while offering significant advantages in terms of power consumption and parallel stream evaluation.},

  abstract = {This PhD thesis will discuss the upgrade of part of the trigger system of ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC AparatuS). ATLAS is one of the
detectors at the world's largest and most powerful particle collider, the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN (European Center of
Nuclear Research, from the french, Conseil Europ\'een pour la Recherche Nucl\'eaire). The trigger system of ATLAS is segmented in
two levels: the first level is implemented with custom electronics, while the second, so-called high-level trigger, is built from
commercial computers, network switchers and custom software. The rate of bunch of particles crossing in the interaction point is 40
MHz and the first level (Level-1) trigger needs to reduce the rate down to 100 kHz with a very low latency of 2.5 us. Part of the Level-1
trigger system, the MUCTPI (Muon to Central Trigger Processor Interface) connects the output of the barrel and endcap muon trigger
to the CTP (Central Trigger Processor). It receives muon candidate information from each of the 208 muon trigger sectors and
calculates the overall muon candidate multiplicity for each of the six transverse momentum (pT) thresholds and sends it to the CTP;
taking into account the possible overlap between trigger sector in order to avoid double counting of muon candidates. The existing
MUCTPI will have to be upgraded as part of the Phase-I Level-1 trigger upgrade program. A full redesign and replacement of the
existing MUCTPI is required in order to provide full-granularity muon RoI information at the bunch crossing (BC) rate to the
Topological Trigger processor (L1Topo) and to be able to interface with the new sector logic modules, which will be deployed as part
of the new small wheel upgrade of the muon endcap trigger. The research issues that arise from the design of a highly-integrated
low-latency trigger module, the first year achievements, and the research plan will be described next.},

In theory it contains a large amount of parallelism and should not be difficult to accelerate sorting of very large datasets on modern architectures. Unfortunately, practical Parallel Sort libraries are very hard to design, they must be carefully tuned and must rely on a number of trade-off depending on the target architecture and target application. In this paper we provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the performance of parallel sorting algorithms on modern multi-core hardware. We consider several general-purpose methods, which are widely regarded among the best algorithms available, with particular interest in sorting of database records and very large arrays (several gigabytes and more), whose size far exceed L2/L3 cache. We provide experimental results, a detailed analysis of shortcomings and advantages of each selected algorithm and an insight onto which algorithm is most suited for a specific application.},

Traditionally, FPGAs have often been employed to meet these requirements. However, due to the productivity challenges, using FPGAs may not be viable in some cases. Alternatively, the typical approach of processing an image on a CPU device at a frame level increases the processing latency of the computer-vision system. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of processing an input image at a sub-frame level on a multi-core SoC device, the 66AK2H12 from TI. Using sub-frame processing, we optimize and evaluate the performance of four kernels commonly used in image-processing pipelines. Our results show, for all four kernels in our study, that real-time, low-latency image processing with high throughput for HD-resolution images can be achieved using the multiple DSP cores available in the 66AK2H12 device.},

  abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of largest scientific instruments ever built. It has been exploring the new energy frontier since 2010, gathering a global user community of 7,000 scientists. To extend its discovery potential, the LHC will need a major upgrade in the 2020s to increase its luminosity (rate of collisions) by a factor of five beyond its design value and the integrated luminosity by a factor of ten. As a highly complex and optimized machine, such an upgrade of the LHC must be carefully studied and requires about ten years to implement. The novel machine configuration, called High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), will rely on a number of key innovative technologies, representing exceptional technological challenges, such as cutting-edge 11\textendash{}12 tesla superconducting magnets, very compact superconducting cavities for beam rotation with ultra-precise phase control, new technology for beam collimation and 300-meter-long high-power superconducting links with negligible energy dissipation.  HL-LHC federates efforts and R\&D; of a large community in Europe, in the US and in Japan, which will facilitate the implementation of the construction phase as a global project.},

  abstract = {Low-power low-loop-bandwidth (BW) integer-N frequency synthesizers with low phase noise have been reported previously. However, achieving similar power/phase-noise performance for a fractional-N synthesizer with a wide loop BW along with excellent spur performance has been challenging. A conventional fractional-N synthesizer is clocked by a crystal oscillator operating at a reference frequency (fref) less than a few tens of megahertz. An attractive alternative is to replace the low-frequency crystal oscillator with an integer-N phase-locked loop operating at an fref of a few hundreds of megahertz. The advantages and challenges of designing such a wide-loop-BW fractional-N synthesizer for low phase noise, spur, and power consumption are considered, and an extended-phase-range type-I {$\Sigma\Delta$} fractional-N frequency synthesizer is implemented with an optimal fref of 290 MHz. Measurement results show that the synthesizer operating at 2.4 GHz with a wide loop BW of 1.8 MHz attains an in-band phase noise of -110 dBc/Hz and a worst case fractional spur of -69 dBc. The digital-intensive 0.18-{$\mu$}m CMOS design consumes 14.1 mW. No quantization noise cancellation or charge pump linearization techniques are used.},

  abstract = {Retiming is a technique for optimizing sequential circuits. It repositions the registers in a circuit leaving the combinational portion of circuitry untouched. The central objective of retiming is to find a circuit with the minimum number of registers for a specified clock period. There are two common variants of this theme; minimizing the clock period without regard to the number of registers in the final circuit or minimizing the number of registers in the final circuit with no constraints on the clock period. Over a decade has elapsed since Leiserson and Saxe first presented a theoretical formulation to solve this problem for single-clock edge-triggered sequential circuits. The proposed algorithms have polynomial complexity. Since then research efforts have focussed on incorporating retiming in a synthesis framework, addressing issues that arise due to retiming, and extending the domain of circuits for which retiming can be applied. This paper presents a survey of retiming as it evolved from a theoretical formulation to a powerful optimization technique available in commercial tools. The issues that arise for a practical implementation of the basic retiming formulation are discussed. Some of the relevant research issues and key contributions are presented.},

The MIOCT (Muon Octant) module firmware has been then modified to extract, encode and send topological information through the existing MUCTPI electrical trigger outputs. The topological information from the muon detectors will be sent to the Level-1 Topological Trigger Processor (L1Topo) through the MUCTPI-to-Level-1-Topological-Processor (MuCTPiToTopo) interface. Examples of physics searches involving muons are: search for Lepton Flavour Violation, Bs-physics, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics and others.

Part of the TDAQ system, the Muon to Central Trigger Processor Interface (MUCTPI) receives muon candidates information from each of the 208 barrel and endcap muon trigger sectors, counts muon candidates for each transverse momentum threshold and sends the result to the Central Trigger Processor (CTP). The MUCTPI takes into account the possible overlap between trigger sectors in order to avoid double counting of muon candidates. A full redesign and replacement of the existing MUCTPI is required in order to provide full-granularity muon position information at the bunch crossing rate to the Topological Trigger processor (L1Topo) and to be able to interface with the new sector logic modules.

  abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2015 will collide proton beams with increased luminosity from 10 34 up to 3 \texttimes{} 10 34 cm -2 s -1 . ATLAS is an LHC experiment designed to measure decay properties of high energetic particles produced in the protons collisions. The higher luminosity places stringent operational and physical requirements on the ATLAS Trigger in order to reduce the 40MHz collision rate to a manageable event storage rate of 1kHz while at the same time, selecting those events with valuable physics meaning. The Level-1 Trigger is the first rate-reducing step in the ATLAS Trigger, with an output rate of 100kHz and decision latency of less than 2.5\textmu{}s. It is composed of the Calorimeter Trigger (L1Calo), the Muon Trigger (L1Muon) and the Central Trigger Processor (CTP). By 2015, there will be a new electronics element in the chain: the Topological Processor System (L1Topo system). The L1Topo system consist of a single AdvancedTCA shelf equipped with three L1Topo processor blades. It will make it possible to use detailed information from L1Calo and L1Muon processed in individual state-of-the-art FPGA processors. This allows the determination of angles between jets and/or leptons and calculates kinematic variables based on lists of selected/sorted objects. The system is designed to receive and process up to 6Tb/s of real time data. The paper reports the relevant upgrades of the Level-1 trigger with focus on the topological processor design and commissioning.},

Optimization is achieved through rational grouping of previously developed methods allowing address-based representation and compact coding of data items. The results of hardware implementation of the algorithms and prototyping in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) demonstrate that: 1) sorting algorithms can be implemented efficiently in low-cost FPGA; 2) the developed coding technique permits data items to be compactly represented in memory; 3) combining different sorting methods produces the best results in terms of performance and memory requirements; 4) low-cost devices can only be used to tackle limited sets of data (up to 220 in a Spartan3 1200 FPGA) and for processing more data either a more powerful FPGA or an external memory is required.},

  abstract = {We present the first all-digital PLL and polar transmitter for mobile phones. They are part of a single-chip GSM/EDGE transceiver SoC fabricated in a 90 nm digital CMOS process. The circuits are architectured from the ground up to be compatible with digital deep-submicron CMOS processes and be readily integrateable with a digital baseband and application processor. To achieve this, we exploit the new paradigm of a deep-submicron CMOS process environment by leveraging on the fast switching times of MOS transistors, the fine lithography and the precise device matching, while avoiding problems related to the limited voltage headroom. The transmitter architecture is fully digital and utilizes the wideband direct frequency modulation capability of the all-digital PLL. The amplitude modulation is realized digitally by regulating the number of active NMOS transistor switches in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude. The conventional RF frequency synthesizer architecture, based on a voltage-controlled oscillator and phase/frequency detector and charge-pump combination, has been replaced with a digitally controlled oscillator and a time-to-digital converter. The transmitter performs GMSK modulation with less than 0.5\textdegree{} rms phase error, -165 dBc/Hz phase noise at 20 MHz offset, and 10 {$\mu$}s settling time. The 8-PSK EDGE spectral mask is met with 1.2\% EVM. The transmitter occupies 1.5 mm2 and consumes 42 mA at 1.2 V supply while producing 6 dBm RF output power.},

  abstract = {In March 2010 ATLAS saw the first proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Within the year, a collision rate of nearly 10 MHz was achieved. At ATLAS, events of potential physics interest are selected by a three-level trigger system, with a final recording rate of about 200 Hz. The first level (LVL1) is implemented in customized hardware, the two levels of the high level trigger (HLT) are software triggers. For the ATLAS physics program more than 500 trigger signatures are defined. The HLT Steering is responsible for testing each signature on each LVL1-accepted event, the test outcome is recorded with the event for later analysis. The steering code also ensures the independence of each signature test and an unbiased trigger decision. To minimize data readout and execution time, cached detector data and once-calculated trigger objects are reused to form the decision. In order to reduce the output rate and further limit the execution time, some signature tests are performed only on an already down scaled fraction of candidate events. For some of these signatures it is important for physics analysts to know the would-be decision on the event fraction that was not analysed due to the down-scaling. For this the HLT-Steering is equipped with a test-after-accept feature. The HLT-Steering receives the setup of the signatures from the trigger configuration system. This system dynamically provides the online setup for the LVL1 and HLT. It also archives the trigger configuration for analysis, which is crucial for understanding trigger efficiencies. We present the performance of the steering and configuration system during the first collisions and the expectations for the LHC phase 1.},

  abstract = {A circuit for detecting the transition of an input signal from one level to another includes comparator means having one input to which is applied the input signal and having another input connected to a digital storage means. The input signal is coupled to the digital storage means via a sampling gate which is controlled by means of feedback derived from the output of the comparator means. The comparator means compares the instantaneous value of the signal versus a previous value of the signal sampled via the sampling means and stored in the storage means. When the input signal changes level and assumes a new value, different from the stored value, the output of the comparator means goes from a first binary value to a second binary value enabling the sampling means and causing the new value of the input signal to be applied to and stored in the digital storage means. The output of the comparator means then returns to the first binary value disabling the sampling means.},

VFz directly computes the candidate filter poles and iteratively relocates them for progressively better approximation. Each VFz iteration consists of the solutions of an overdetermined linear equation and an eigenvalue problem, with real-domain arithmetic to accommodate complex poles. Pole flipping and maximum pole radius constraint guarantee stability and robustness against finite-precision implementation. Comparison against existing algorithms confirms that VFz generally exhibits fast convergence and produces highly accurate IIR approximants.},

  abstract = {Frequency synthesis at mm-Waves is still dominated by analog PLLs, although all-digital PLLs (ADPLLs) [1] have been widely explored below 10GHz. The major obstacle has been the poor quality of digitally controlled oscillators (DCO) as MOS varactor Q-factor drops to {$<$};10 at 60GHz. A mm-Wave digital transmitter (TX) based on a 60GHz fractional-N ADPLL with two-point FM is proposed here. The TX features extensive reconfigurability and permits the highest degree of integration of RF and baseband circuitry for low-cost, high-volume applications. To simplify the TX architecture, the synthesizer is capable of FM, hence a time-to-digital converter (TDC) is preferred over bang-bang phase detection. With the aid of autonomous calibrations of DCO and TDC gain, wideband two-point FM is achieved.},

New bounds on U(t,N) and T(t,N) are presented. In particular, U(3,N) is determined to within a constant of 2, and asymptotic formulae for U(t,N) and T(t,N) are given for fixed t.},

  abstract = {There have been ample successful examples of applying Xilinx Vivado's ``function-to-module'' high-level synthesis (HLS) where the subject is algorithmic in nature. In this work, we carried out a design study to assess the effectiveness of applying Vivado-HLS in structural design. We employed Vivado-HLS to synthesize C functions corresponding to standalone network-on-chip (NoC) routers as well as complete multi-endpoint NoCs. Interestingly, we find that describing a complete NoC comprising router submodules faces fundamental difficulties not present in describing the routers as standalone modules. Ultimately, we succeeded in using Vivado-HLS to produce router and NoC modules that are exact cycle- and bit-accurate replacements of our reference RTL-based router and NoC modules. Furthermore, the routers and NoCs resulting from HLS and RTL are comparable in resource utilization and critical path delay. Our experience subjectively suggests that HLS is able to simplify the design effort even though much of the structural details had to be provided in the HLS description through a combination of coding discipline and explicit pragmas. The C++ source code can be found at http://www.ece.cmu.edu/calcm/connect\_hls.},
